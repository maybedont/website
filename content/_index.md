## MCP Security

A new protocol requires a new policy

### De-risk AI. Avoid disaster.

In the time it took you to read this there was a major security breach caused by an AI agent

...we just don't know about it, yet.

### Intercept. Analyze. Control.

Maybe Don't AI sits between AI agents and MCP servers, monitoring every request â€” requiring validation on nefarious actions before they happen.

### Enterprise-Grade Security

Zero visibility means big risk. Don't be tomorrow's headline. Build security into AI workflows with real-time auditing.

### Easy Integration

Plug-and-play APIs. Start intercepting AI activity in minutes, not months. See everything and stop bad AI actors in real time.

### Don't be the breach story.

Try it out during our early access phase, and please send us all the feedback.

Maybe Don't AI uses a combination of ai detection, a policy engine, human in the loop (where necessary) and anomaly detection to give you confidence with your ai agents.
