# Introducing Multi-Client Support in Maybe Don't: Seamlessly Connect to Multiple MCP Servers

We’re excited to introduce a major enhancement to [Maybe Don’t AI's MCP Gateway](https://maybedont.ai): **multi-client support for connecting to multiple MCP servers in parallel**. This new feature is designed to help organizations scale their use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) securely and efficiently.

## What is Maybe Don’t?

Maybe Don’t is proprietary software designed for **MCP security**. Acting as an MCP gateway, it provides a layer of safety, oversight, and control between your AI deployments and the world at large. It ensures that AI systems operating under the MCP maintain compliance with your safety policies, security procedures, and organizational governance.

In essence, Maybe Don’t functions as a security checkpoint for AI systems by offering:

- **Request filtering and validation:** Ensure that all interactions with your AI adhere to your policies.
- **Intervention capabilities:** Block or modify unauthorized requests or outputs.
- **Audit logging:** Provide detailed records of all interactions for compliance and review.

Maybe Don’t is trusted by enterprises and institutions to safeguard their AI operations while leveraging the flexibility and interoperability of MCP.

## Why Multi-Client Support?

MCP has gained significant traction as the leading protocol for managing AI interactions, and organizations increasingly find themselves operating multiple MCP servers for different teams, environments, or applications. Previously, the Maybe Don’t MCP Gateway client was limited to connecting with a single MCP server at any given time. This created challenges for teams managing large-scale or distributed AI deployments, including:

- **Fragmented oversight:** Teams had to manage separate client instances for each MCP server.
- **Lack of coordination:** No easy way to route requests or share audit logs across servers.
- **Operational inefficiency:** Increased workload and potential for misconfiguration.

## The Multi-Client Solution

The latest update introduces **multi-client support**, enabling Maybe Don’t's MCP Gateway to connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously. This update transforms Maybe Don’t into a unified control plane for managing your entire MCP infrastructure.

### Key Features:

1. **Simultaneous connections:** Manage and interact with multiple MCP servers from a single Maybe Don’t instance.
2. **Unified API and interface:** Centralized configuration, monitoring, and logging for all servers.
3. **Cross-server orchestration:** Aggregate or route requests and policies across servers with ease.

This new architecture supports advanced use cases, such as federated management of security policies, global request routing, and consolidated audit logging for compliance.

## Why It Matters

- **Scalability:** Easily manage dozens of MCP servers as your organization’s AI footprint grows.
- **Security:** Maintain consistent oversight and reduce risks by centralizing your gateway operations.
- **Productivity:** Save time by managing all MCP connections in one place and eliminate manual switching.

## Get Started Today

To take advantage of multi-client support:

1. **Update your Maybe Don’t client** to the latest version.
2. **Configure your MCP connections** in the client dashboard or configuration file.
3. **Enjoy streamlined management** for all your MCP servers.
