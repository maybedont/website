# Your AI Agent Never Touched a Hot Stove

When I was around 9 years old I would put on my rollerblades and all my pads and rollerblade to the top of the street on the hill we lived on and then I would skate as fast as I could and just lay down on my pads and roll down the mountain. This was pretty fun for a while until a part of my arm caught the road—and I learned that was a bad idea.

Today I care about doing what I say I'm going to do because I remember showing up for school and not having my homework done. And the embarrassment I felt over saying I'd do it and not getting it done sunk in. The life experience stuck with me—I don't want to let people down.

I've learned a million lessons like this. Letters I should never have written, and those I should have but didn't. Things I said that I shouldn't have, and things I failed to say. I have touched fire, and hot mufflers, and stoves and learned just how much I don't want to repeat those things.

Essential to humanity is life experience.

When you hire a Junior Engineer you may have some company policies to keep them from getting in trouble, but you do expect them to come to the table with some common sense.

And that is what makes a Junior Engineer so different from an AI agent. The AI has "learned" (for some value of learned) about hot stoves, and scraped knees, and embarrassment from let downs. But it also has not learned it at all. You're out here giving your AI agents access to the world, when the AI has never been in the world.

## The Missing Scar Tissue

Your AI agent has read about bankruptcy. It's never felt the gut-punch of watching a bank account drain. It's parsed millions of customer service transcripts. It's never had someone scream at it until it cried. It knows the definition of "reputation damage." It's never been the person who has to explain to the board why an automated email just insulted 50,000 customers.

This isn't a flaw in the AI. It's the nature of the thing. And pretending otherwise is how companies end up in headlines they never wanted.

## Guardrails Aren't Training Wheels—They're Seatbelts

This is why we built Maybe Don't, AI.

We're not here to slow your agents down. We're here to give them the judgment they literally cannot have. The system operates on a spectrum: from gentle linting that flags questionable decisions for human review, to hard policy enforcement that stops catastrophic actions cold.

Think of it as the institutional knowledge your AI never accumulated. The "maybe don't send that email at 2am" instinct. The "maybe don't approve that $50,000 purchase order without a second look" pause. The "maybe don't delete that database table" hard stop.

Your agents get to move fast. But they move fast within boundaries that reflect actual operational wisdom—the kind humans earn through years of mistakes you can't afford to let an AI repeat at scale.

## The Math Is Simple

One unchecked AI action can cost more than a year of guardrails. We've seen agents spin up infrastructure that burned through six figures in hours. We've watched automated responses tank customer relationships that took a decade to build. The velocity that makes AI agents valuable is the same velocity that makes them dangerous.

Maybe Don't sits between your agent and the world, applying the life experience it will never have.
