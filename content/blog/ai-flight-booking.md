What is the reason you’re not currently using AI to book airplane tickets for yourself?
For a lot of people, it’s a simple lack of awareness that this is even an option. But for most technical people, the awareness is there—the hesitation comes from trust.
Personally, my problem isn’t ignorance. 

My problem is confidence. 

If I ask an AI to book a flight from Denver to Seattle, I worry it’ll somehow decide to route me through Dubai because it thinks that’s cheaper or “better.” Even if the AI confirms with me before purchasing, mistakes can still creep in. Just last week, when I was fully in control, I booked tickets for my wife and accidentally put them under my own name. That mistake cost me more than half the ticket price to fix.
Now imagine an AI agent making that kind of decision for you, with your money and your schedule on the line.

We're building the safety infrastructure for the agentic AI revolution, and it starts with one simple principle: you should be in control of what AI does on your behalf.

## The Trust Gap in AI Agents

Right now, we're at an inflection point. AI agents can technically handle complex tasks like booking flights, managing calendars, or making purchases. But there's a massive trust gap between what AI *can* do and what we're comfortable *letting* it do. This isn't about AI capability—it's about control and confidence.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has opened up incredible possibilities for AI agents to interact with external systems. Your LLM can now connect to thousands of services, databases, and APIs. But with great power comes great potential for expensive mistakes. Without proper guardrails, an AI agent might book you a "great deal" on a flight that leaves at 3 AM, requires four layovers, or worse—books it for the wrong date entirely.

## Why Generic Safety Isn't Enough

Every person, every company, and every use case has unique requirements and risk tolerances. Maybe you never want to spend more than $500 on a flight without confirmation. Maybe your company requires all API calls to stay within specific rate limits. Maybe you want your AI to never book meetings before 10 AM because you're not a morning person.

These aren't universal rules—they're *your* rules. And they shouldn't require you to write complex prompts or hope the AI remembers your preferences from conversation to conversation.

## Enter Maybe Don't AI

Maybe Don't AI is the control layer between your AI agents and the real world. Think of it as a customizable safety net that catches potentially problematic actions before they happen. 

Our platform integrates seamlessly with MCP-enabled systems, allowing you to do things like:

- **Set spending limits** on any financial transaction
- **Define working hours** for calendar bookings
- **Create approval workflows** for sensitive operations  
- **Establish rate limits** to prevent API abuse
- **Build custom rules** using simple, natural language

You shouldn't need to be a prompt engineer to feel safe using AI agents. With Maybe Don't AI, you define your boundaries once, and they're enforced automatically across all your AI interactions.

## The Future is Agentic—But It Should Be Safe

We believe AI agents will transform how we work and live, handling countless tasks that currently eat up our time. But this future only works if people trust these systems. Trust isn't built on promises—it's built on control, transparency, and reliability.

Maybe Don't AI isn't about limiting AI's potential. It's about unleashing it safely. When you know your AI agent can't accidentally drain your bank account or book you on a red-eye to Dubai, you're free to delegate more tasks and reclaim more of your time.
